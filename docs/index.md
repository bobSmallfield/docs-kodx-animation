# KODX Animation

## Introduction

This is not an animation program like others. _KODX Animation_ is more like a 'generator'. You will quickly set things up, and be able to create profesional coding animations only providing the script.

## Program Layout

* **Left panel** - Two tabs.
    * **Logs** - The status of your actions.
    * **Preview** - You can see a preview of your last frame here.
* **Code** - Your code. You can directly paste and edit your code here.
* **Settings** - Manage the settings of your animation.
* **Export** - File settings.

## Workflow

When you open the program, it keeps all the settings exactly as you left them. So once you’ve configured the styles the way you want, the only thing you need to do is write your script. After that, just click Export. Quick and easy.
